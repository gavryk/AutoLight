				<p>Without further ado, we’re going to show how to install <a href="#">Dodge Ram Fog Lights</a>. We’ve got our kit here for our Fog Lights, comes with everything you need to install these onto your truck with your mounting brackets and all your bolts, the nuts and washers so we can just put this things right on the truck.</p>
				<p>Now, what we did to make this work on our bumper is this brackets that you see. They come just like this. What we’ve done, is we’ve gone ahead and put a little xx and attach them to the back of our fog light. There are screw places on here, where these would attach if you were going to side mouth these, or if you mount them like a standard fog light than you would use this melt but we’re going to mount them up a little bit different on our bumper so we have the kind of make a little bracket on the side there and I’ll show you be here in just a minute.</p>
				<h3>Exactly why and where we're putting</h3>
				<p>Exactly why and where we’re putting that, so let’s get started on it. As you guys can see in here the bracket that comes with the bumper, and the way that it’s designed, hence the reason for our redesign of that straight bracket into a bent one like that so that it’ll fit in there and this particular bumper, if we tried to use the standard style nine brackets, it’d put our fog light way up here and that just absolutely will work so we just bent those words that come with the. OK, so once we’ve got that in the place where we want it, I’ll go ahead and get some wrenches and tighten that up.
				</p>
				<p>We’ve got both fog lights in on both sides now so we’re ready to go ahead and wire these up. The easiest, simplest way to wire, these new fog lights into our bumper is what we did is we just took the factory harness which plugs in here, and then, as you can see on here this is the factory bulb, we cut the end off of the wiring harness for the factory bulb, and what we did is we put blade connectors on here, so that we can attach them right up to our new fog lights.
